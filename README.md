# FCC-Tribute-Page
Project One of Responsive Web Design Certification

Styling is minimalistic to adhere to the testing suite via Free Code Camp.

Will come back at a later date to spruce it up,  but imagery and the page itself is very responsive to varying window sizing which I'm quite pleased with.
